    <h1>Clive Gomes: Background and Ambitions</h1>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most common question kids are asked is about what they want to be when they grow
      up; for the most part of my childhood, I could never come up with a clear answer. Growing up,
      I was fascinated by everything around me! I guess I am one of those people who thinks
      everything is possible with the right amount of effort, and so I was eager to try out as much
      as I could. Music lessons, soccer team, student council, I had to try it all! Even then, I
      wasn’t really satisfied.

      The summer before eighth grade, my parents signed me up for Robotics Camp, where I learned
      about sensors and motors for the very first time. I was intrigued by what I could accomplish
      with just a few lines of code and curiously asked the instructor what else the robot could do.
      “Anything you’d like!” was the reply. My childish self quickly thought of an idea — “If I were
      to write a program to create a second me, I could do so many other things I’ve never had the
      time for!” Looking back, that was probably the moment my passion for programming developed.

      After returning home, I asked my parents to teach me everything they knew about computers. I
      also enrolled in a few different certification courses to get a professional touch. Noting my
      interest in creating a human-like computer program, one of my then professors encouraged me to
      read the book “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach” by Russell and Norvig. I quickly
      realized that creating an AI wasn’t going to be as easy as I initially thought; I would need
      to strengthen my fundamentals first.

      With that goal in mind, I enrolled at Illinois Tech, Chicago, to pursue a Dual Degree in
      Electrical and Computer Engineering. Planning tasks and learning by observation have always
      been my strong suits. In addition, I have always been interested in the way people think —
      more specifically, the way they express themselves through language (owing to which I can now
      hold a basic conversion in five different languages). Thanks to that, “perception,”
      “cognition,” and “language” are the three aspects of the human mind I’ve been most interested
      in. Accordingly, apropos of elective courses required for my major, I’ve always opted for
      classes that, at least to some extent, relate to one of these areas. Furthermore, I decided to
      pursue a minor in Psychology and enrolled in classes like Neuroscience and Learning Theory,
      among others. The more I learned, the more my interest in people increased. It was then that I
      decided to attend semester-long courses in France and Japan. Back at my home university, I
      joined the robotics organization on campus to have the opportunity to work with and learn from
      others, while also getting a more hands-on experience apropos of the things I learned in my
      classes. As a participant of the NASA Robotics Mining Competition, one of my main
      responsibilities was to plan the autonomous navigation of the robot, in which I employed a
      modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm using topological sort for the basic pathfinding task
      — one of the things I learned in the AI book I read in high school. I was also glad to find a
      class on web design (something I’ve wanted to learn since middle school; though have never
      gone beyond the very basics) offered as a Humanities, which is why I was extremely excited to
      take this class during my final semester at Illinois Tech. With only a few months until
      graduation, perhaps my one regret would be that I wasn’t able to apply for an internship,
      though recently, I was a Teaching Assistant for the “Intro to Electrical and Computer
      Engineering” class at Illinois Tech. That said, I do believe I have gotten the most out of my
      time in college, so I am optimistic about the future.
